# Brain Tumor Detection using Custom Trained SegFormer

This project demonstrates the use of a **custom-trained SegFormer model** for brain tumor detection from MRI scans using semantic segmentation. The solution includes a PyTorch training pipeline and a Streamlit dashboard for real-time predictions.
